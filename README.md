# <img src="#"> OctoBoard


OctoBoard is a management system for job seekers which hosts information on applications, interviews, follow-up dates, and job preparedness aspects such as interview questions/responses and application materials. I decided to build this app because it solved an issue that many of my peers faced when trying to organize all job application process details and encouraged better preparation and job search practices.
