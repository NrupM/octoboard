# <img src="#"> OctoBoard


OctoBoard is a personal organizational tool for job seekers which stores information on job applications, upcoming interviews, follow-up dates, and job preparedness aspects such as interview questions/responses. I decided to build this app because it solves an issue that many of my peers face when trying to organize job search process details and it encourages better preparation and practices.
